osc-repl
=========

A REPL for sending OSC messages to some configured server.

This is a command-line app.  When you start it you can optionally provide the path to a config file, as well some OSC messages to pre-populate the Readline history of the REPL.


If you omit any arguments it assumes there is a file named '.osc-config.yaml' in the current directory.

If you want to pass in a set of OSC messages to stash in Readline history then the first argument must be the path of the config file and then each OSC message must be separated by a comma.

For example:


    osc-repl 

    osc-repl /home/james/.my-global-osc-conf.yaml

    osc-repl .osc-config.yaml /renoise/transport/start, /renoise/transport/stop,  /renoise/song/bpm 90 , /renoise/trigger/note_on 1 2 13 125


You can omit the full path if the config file is in the current working directory.


The config file must be a YAML file that has at least two keys:

    :address: <IP address of OSC server>
    :port: <port number of OSC server>


 You can also use the config file to preload some OSC commands:


    :initial_messages: 
     - /animata/layer/layer_0001/image jgb-doll2.png
     - /animata/move/joint head 10.0 10.0


The program runs in a loop, giving you a command-line prompt, awaiting your bidding.

You enter the OSC address pattern and args (if any) to send and hit Enter.

Once the app is running it never reloads the config file.

The apps sends the OSC message and waits for the next command.

You can send integers, floats, and strings. Sorry, no OSC blob support. Or that OSC time-stamp thing either. As a practical matter, anecdotal experience says that 99% of the OSC use case will involve floats, and maybe integers.

You need to quote any string arguments using the double-quotes character.  Numbers should be auto-recognized.

For example:


    /renoise/transport/start
    
    /renoise/song/bpm  124

    /some/other/messsage 123 14.14 "This is some text"

Do not use commas to separate the arguments.  They might work, or they might confuse the simple arguments parser in the app.

The app uses the `readline` lib so you can use the arrow keys to recall previous commands, inclusing the commands you may have included when first launching the program.

Enter 'q' or 'Q' to quit.

The app does not yet show any replies sent back from the OSC server.

This program is something of a variation of the OSC Commander created for the book [Just the Best Parts: OSC for Artists](http://osc.justthebestparts.com).  That version is written in Processing, uses a GUI, and has a few more features.

This Ruby version is easier in many ways, not the least being that you can just invoke it from the command line to quickly send some OSC messages, and the Readline support makes it quick and easy to recall and edit or reuse previous commands.
